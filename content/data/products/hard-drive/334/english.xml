      <points title="Lightweight and portable">
        <point>
          The drive's lightweight design makes it easy to take it with you. Thanks to its compact form factor, it takes up very little room on your desktop. Since it's powered by a USB port, there's no separate power cable to plug in or carry. It's an ideal on-the-go companion for laptops and USB-compatible tablets.

	  <points title="USB 3.0 for faster data transfers">
        <point>
          Dell's portable hard drive features USB 3.0, which is up to 10 times faster than USB 2.0. This means files transfer more quickly between the drive and your device and backups finish sooner. It's also backward compatible with USB 2.0 and USB 1.0, so older devices can still connect to this drive.
